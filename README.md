# Features

* *Factorial Calculation:*
    * factorial(int n): Calculates the factorial of a given integer n using long. It throws an IllegalArgumentException for negative inputs.
    * factorialBig(int n): Calculates the factorial of a given integer n using BigInteger, allowing for calculations of very large factorials.
* *Fibonacci Sequence Calculation:*
    * fibonacci(int n): Calculates the nth Fibonacci number using long. It throws an IllegalArgumentException for non-positive inputs.
* *Performance Measurement:*
    * The main method includes code to measure the execution time of each function using System.nanoTime(), providing insights into performance.

# Usage

1.  *Compilation:*
    * Compile the Java code using a Java compiler (e.g., javac MathFunctions.java).
2.  *Execution:*
    * Run the compiled class file (e.g., java MathFunctions).
3.  *Example Output:*

This Java library, MathFunctions, provides implementations of common mathematical functions, including factorial and Fibonacci sequence calculations.

# Functions

# factorial(int n)

Calculates the factorial of a given non-negative integer n using long data type.

* *Parameters:*
    * n (int): The non-negative integer for which to calculate the factorial.
* *Returns:*
    * long: The factorial of n.
* *Throws:*
    * IllegalArgumentException: If n is negative.
* *Note:* This method is suitable for smaller values of n where the result fits within the range of a long.

# factorialBig(int n)

Calculates the factorial of a given non-negative integer n using BigInteger for handling large results.

* *Parameters:*
    * n (int): The non-negative integer for which to calculate the factorial.
* *Returns:*
    * BigInteger: The factorial of n.
* *Throws:*
    * IllegalArgumentException: If n is negative.
* *Note:* This method is suitable for larger values of n that exceed the range of long.

# fibonacci(int n)

Calculates the nth Fibonacci number.

* *Parameters:*
    * n (int): The position of the Fibonacci number to calculate (must be a positive integer).
* *Returns:*
    * long: The nth Fibonacci number.
* *Throws:*
    * IllegalArgumentException: If n is not a positive integer.

# Usage

To use this library, compile the MathFunctions.java file and run the main method. The main method demonstrates the usage of each function and measures their execution time.

# Compilation

```bash
javac MathFunctions.java
